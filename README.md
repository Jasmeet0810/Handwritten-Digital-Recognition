Handwritten Digit Recognition
This project implements a machine learning model for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model takes grayscale images of digits (0–9) and predicts the correct numerical label using a trained neural network or classical machine learning algorithm.

Overview
The goal of this project is to classify images of handwritten digits using machine learning. It uses a well-known dataset of labeled digit images and applies classification techniques such as:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machines

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Features
Preprocessed and normalized digit image dataset (MNIST)
Multiple ML algorithms to compare performance
Accuracy evaluation using a confusion matrix and a classification report
Visualizations of predictions and misclassified digits
Train/test split for fair model evaluation

Tech Stack
Python 3.x
NumPy
pandas
matplotlib & seaborn
scikit-learn
TensorFlow or PyTorch (optional, for deep learning)

Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
Git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
cd handwritten-digit-recognition

2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the notebook
Open the Jupyter or Google Colab notebook and execute the cells step-by-step:
