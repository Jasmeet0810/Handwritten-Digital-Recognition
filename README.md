# Handwritten Digit Classifier with PyTorch

This project implements a simple yet effective feed-forward neural network using **PyTorch** to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**. The model is trained, evaluated, and visualized using Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Feed-forward neural network (784 â†’ 128 â†’ 64 â†’ 10)
- Trained on the classic MNIST dataset
- Achieves over **97% accuracy** on the test set
- Includes data visualization and class probability plots
- Built using PyTorch and Torchvision
- Ready-to-run in **Google Colab**

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mnist-pytorch-classifier.git
cd mnist-pytorch-classifier

2. Install Dependencies (if running locally)
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you're using Google Colab, dependencies like torch, torchvision, and matplotlib are already installed.

ðŸ“Š Model Architecture
The network has the following architecture:

Arduino
Input: 784 (28x28 flattened image)
â†“
Linear (784 â†’ 128) + ReLU
â†“
Linear (128 â†’ 64) + ReLU
â†“
Linear (64 â†’ 10) + LogSoftmax
Loss Function: Negative Log-Likelihood (NLLLoss)

Optimizer: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with Momentum

ðŸ§ª Results
Metric	Value
Test Accuracy	~97.2%

ðŸ“ˆ Visualization Example
The notebook includes visualization of:
Sample MNIST images
Class probabilities for predictions
Misclassifications and confidence levels

ðŸ“Œ Dataset
Source: MNIST (Yann LeCun)
60,000 training images and 10,000 test images
Grayscale images of handwritten digits (0â€“9)

Let me know if you'd like:
- A version adapted for CNN instead of feed-forward
- A badge section (Python version, Colab badge, etc.)
- Screenshots or diagrams included

I'm happy to help further!
